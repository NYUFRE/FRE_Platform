                        In this project, the generally idea is to test a hypothesis from behavioral 
                        finance that market movement is correlated with the market sentiments. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To do that, I firstly apply sentiment analysis on daily twitter post about a 
                        particular stock, and then construct mood indicators through sentiment analysis. 
                        To find the potential correlation between market sentiment and stock price, 
                        I will then carry out correlation test between mood indicator and stock price movement 
                        data (specifically, Microsoft). To explore further, I then utilize machine learning 
                        model to predict the next day stock market movement by three sentimentâ€™s indicators 
                        (positive, negative, neutral) extracted from twitter. To test our results, 
                        we will do cross validation method as well as other classification metrics to test the accuracy score of 
                        the prediction.

                        3.1	Twitter data fetching from Snscrap
                       </strong> 
                    </p>	
                    <p> 
                        To have access to twitter data, it normally requires a twitter API 
                        authentication from twitter developer account. However, due to the policy 
                        change, an end user (except for academic PhD thesis usage) will not be able 
                        to access historical tweets from twitter API, and there is also a limit on 
                        the number of tweets to which a user has access. Therefore, in this project 
                        I will use a python package Snscrape, which is a scraper for social networking 
                        services (SNS). It scrapes things like user profiles, hashtags, or searches 
                        and returns the discovered items, e.g., the relevant posts. 
                        Snscrape usage is also friendly and straight forward. It support searching 
                        tweets, hashtags with a given date range. It will return all the discovered
                         historical tweets within that date range. The function will also auto-parse 
                         the json file from twitter website and return a pre-defined tweet object 
                         containing all the information about discovered items.

                        3.2	Text analysis using NLTK
                        </strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with natural 
                        language processing tasks. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50
                        corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text 
                        processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, 
                        parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP 
                        libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong style="color: blue;">
                        3.3	Detailed implementation
                        </strong> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As illustrated in the above graph, I will firstly use Snscrape to search and 
                        fetch historical tweets from Jan 1st, 2020 to Jan 1st 2022 with the keyword 
                        such as $MSFT, # Microsoft, #Windows etc. Then collect them into one data 
                        frame with fields including user id, content, timestamp etc. All the contents
                        data will be load into NLTK module for natural language processing. The model 
                        I am going to use for NPL sentiments analysis will be nltk.sentiment.vader 
                        module. This model is a parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis. 
                        It will output a sentiment score (indicators) corresponding to each tweet 
                        content. The score has three dimensions (positive, negative, neutral). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for the machine learning part: Once I have the sentiment indicators ready, 
                        I will use machine learning classifier model, such as Random Forest, SVM, 
                        Logistic Regression, to fit the sentiment score at time T and stock price 
                        movement at time T+1. Note here that MSFT price movement data is pre-processed
                        to be valued 1 or -1 each day depending on its price movement direction 
                        compared to the previous day. If at time t and price goes up, the value at 
                        t will be 1, and vice versa. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to measure the ML prediction accuracy, a cross-validation accuracy 
                        measure will be used. Since we have a binary classification problem, I will 
                        also introduce a ROC curve to measure the classifier efficacy. 
                    </p>
